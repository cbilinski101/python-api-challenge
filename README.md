# python-api-challenge

### Update Oct 23, 2024

### Fixed the following issues:

For each city in the hotel_df DataFrame, use the Geoapify API to find the first hotel 
located within 10,000 metres of your coordinates 

Add the hotel name and the country as additional information in the hover message for 
each city in the map. 

Updated scatterplots to show gridlines.

Updated the line regression scatterplots - now the line regression is defined before use, and the titles and layout are all improved.

I accessed help through Xpert Learning Assiant, and various classmates using Slack.

Included in this repoistory: "READEME, WeatherPy folder containing: 

2 jupiter notebooks -  'VacationPy' & 'WeatherPY, (also gitignore).

Part 1 'WeatherPy' - I managed to do the following :

Use the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data from the cities list generated in 
the started code 

Create a scatter plot to showcase the relationship between Latitude vs. Temperature

Create a scatter plot to showcase the relationship between Latitude vs. Humidity

Create a scatter plot to showcase the relationship between Latitude vs. Cloudiness 

Create a scatter plot to showcase the relationship between Latitude vs. Wind Speed 

Linear regression scatter plot for Northern Hemisphere: Temperature (C) vs. Latitude 

Linear regression scatter plot for Southern Hemisphere: Temperature (C) vs. Latitude

Linear regression scatter plot for Northern Hemisphere: Humidity (%) vs. Latitude

Linear regression scatter plot for Southern Hemisphere: Humidity (%) vs. Latitude

Linear regression scatter plot for Northern Hemisphere: Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude 

Linear regression scatter plot for Southern Hemisphere: Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude 

Linear regression scatter plot for Northern Hemisphere: Wind Speed (m/s) vs. Latitude 

Linear regression scatter plot for Southern Hemisphere: Wind Speed (m/s) vs. Latitude 

Part 2 'VacationPy' - I managed to do the following:

Create a map that displays a point for every city in the city_data_df DataFrame 

Narrow down the city_data_df DataFrame to find your ideal weather condition

I was not able to complete the following:

For each city in the hotel_df DataFrame, use the Geoapify API to find the first hotel 
located within 10,000 metres of your coordinates 

Add the hotel name and the country as additional information in the hover message for 
each city in the map.
